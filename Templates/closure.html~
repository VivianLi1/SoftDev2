Closures

1. func declared in another func
2. inner func accesses a vairbale from the outer func (outside scope of inner func)
3. ext func binds a value to the variable and finishes (closes) before the inner func can be completed

def repeat(s):
def times(x):
return s * x
return times

this is nested, but not a closure bc s, the ext variable to times, is not bound to any
